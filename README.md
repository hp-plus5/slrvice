# SLRvice
A simple app for taking notes while taking photos using an SLR camera

App should:
Be PWA
Store data locally (optionally, until internet is accessible and then uploads, but not necessarily)
Do minimal else

Rough data structure:
```
{
  "rollOfFilm": {
    "brand:": {},
    "type": {},
    "dateStarted": {},
    "dateCompleted": {},
    "exposureCount": {},
    "exposures": {
      "shotNumber": {},
      "iso": {},
      "fStop": {},
      "shutterSpeed": {},
      "notes": {}
    }
  }
}
```
